// This file is intentionally left blank.
// The original content `/// <reference types="vite/client" />` was causing a
// TypeScript error because the type definitions could not be found.
// As the project does not use any Vite-specific client-side features
// that rely on these types (like `import.meta.env`), removing the reference
// is a safe way to resolve the build error.
